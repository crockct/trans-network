							<p class="list-group-item-text">Sex is strictly biological - the physical body - while gender 
							encompasses biological, cognitive, and social aspects of a human being, including identity, 
							expression, and the expectations of others. Because gender and sex are not the same thing, 
							it is possible for a person's sex and gender to disagree. When this happens, it can be extremely 
							problematic for the person dealing with this incongruity, and it can often be life-threatening, 
							due to the potential for suicide. This sex/gender incongruity has been determined by many 
							professional organizations and courts to be a medical condition.</p>

							<h3 class="list-group-item-heading">Does being transgender mean I'm gay?</h3>
							<p class="list-group-item-text">Gender identity and sexual orientation are different concepts in 
							Western culture. Sexual orientation refers to a person's attractions. Gender identity refers to who 
							a person believes him- or herself to be. Transgender and transsexual people can have any sexual 
							orientation. It is also possible for sexual attraction to change after transition. It is better 
							not to put too much importance on labels such as gay, lesbian, and straight. In many ways, trans 
							people confound the ''simple'' expectations of sexual orientation that go with such labels.</p>

							<h3 class="list-group-item-heading">I think my partner might be trans*</h3>
							<p class="list-group-item-text">I think my partner is questioning his gender identity. 
							He is maab and has been talking a lot about how he doesn't feel comfortable with male gender 
							roles, and seems to have some body dysphoria. He is struggling with not conforming to gender
							roles; he says he feels guilty. I 100% support him no matter what, but as a ciswoman I don't 
							know how he is feeling or what I should do. He hasn't explicitly told me he's questioning, and 
							obviously I don't want to push him on this. How can I be most supportive?</p>
