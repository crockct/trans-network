  <td><b>Eve's Story</b> <br> I've just got off the phone with one of my childhood bullies. He used to call me names and hit me on the way home from school, but we're friends now. He's slightly in awe of my life today and, to be honest, so am I. This year has been intense. I have served as assistant editor of Gay Times, debuted as both Channel 4 and Radio 1's first transgender presenter, fronted a successful awareness-raising campaign, All About Trans, topped the Independent on Sunday's Pink List, partied with celebs, brightened up Question Time, travelled the country, spoken everywhere from Oxford University to Amnesty International, and written for the Telegraph, NME and the Guardian. Life wasn't always this good.

<br>"He's only four, he doesn't know what he's saying!" That's how my friend Emma, only eight herself, defended me from the older boys in the park. I'm a girl, I'd told them, though I didn't say it out loud again. They hadn't believed me; they'd just laughed. Adults weren't keen on me saying it, either, and I soon got the message that I wasn't (and never could be) a girl – I had a penis and that was that. I'd understand when I was older, apparently. When kids asked me why I "speak like a girl", I'd tell them: "Maybe this is just how I talk." I was beaten up a lot. A few years later I wore borrowed tights to school and used the girls' toilets. No one knew what to do with me.

<br>In my hometown of Hucknall, near Nottingham, there was one gay guy, who everyone was friendly with because he made them laugh, and one Asian family, who everyone knew because they owned a corner shop. This ex-mining community was unofficially headed up by the local hard man, a bouncer and former boxer who also happened to be my dad. My mother was 17 when she had me and found it hard to cope. My parents had a fiery breakup when I was a baby, so her sister, my lovely Aunty Rachael, and her mother, my caring grandmother – or Mama, pronounced "Mammar" in Hucknall – helped bring me up. I like to think I have my mama's kindness, my mum's charisma and my auntie's morals. What none of them passed on to me, unfortunately, was a womb.
