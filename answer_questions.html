							<h3 class="list-group-item-heading">What is the difference between sex and gender?</h3>
							<p class="list-group-item-text">Sex is strictly biological - the physical body - while gender 
							encompasses biological, cognitive, and social aspects of a human being, including identity, 
							expression, and the expectations of others. Because gender and sex are not the same thing, 
							it is possible for a person's sex and gender to disagree. When this happens, it can be extremely 
							problematic for the person dealing with this incongruity, and it can often be life-threatening, 
							due to the potential for suicide. This sex/gender incongruity has been determined by many 
							professional organizations and courts to be a medical condition.</p>

							He is maab and has been talking a lot about how he doesn't feel comfortable with male gender 
							roles, and seems to have some body dysphoria. He is struggling with not conforming to gender

							obviously I don't want to push him on this. How can I be most supportive?</p>
